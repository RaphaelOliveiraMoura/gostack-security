# üëÄ Overview

```
  ~ yarn install
  ~ docker-compose up -d

  ~ yarn sequelize db:create
  ~ yarn sequelize db:migrate
  ~ yarn sequelize db:seed:all

  ~ yarn build
  ~ yarn start
```

To run email service:

```
  ~ yarn queue
```

I choose not use **sucrase** because I wanted to configurate root import plugin in the app, and then the way that I found was use **babel** instead sucrase.

# üöÄ Preparing and running application

## Installing project and dependences

```
  ~ git clone https://github.com/RaphaelOliveiraMoura/gostack-gympoint.git
  ~ cd gostack-gympoint/backend
  ~ yarn install (or npm install)
```

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or another setted Postgres service

First, you need to create a **.env** file in root of application. The structure of this file is similar to the **.env.example** file, just copy and put the correct informations for all variables.

## Setting database with docker compose

### Starting postgres service with docker compose

If you dont have postgres service installed localy, you can install it with **docker compose**:

```
  ~ docker-compose up -d
```

The postgres container will be created with a user and password setted in **.env** file.

If you try create postgres service with docker compose with a local postgres service running, you will receive a error because the service is already running in the local port 5432.

You can stop postgres service in linux with the command:

```
  ~ sudo systemctl stop postgresql.service
```

### Creating and configurating database

```
  ~ yarn sequelize db:create
  ~ yarn sequelize db:migrate
  ~ yarn sequelize db:seed:all
```

You can start the application with fake data, for this just put `FAKE_DATA` env variable as `true`. This fake data is generated by seeders.

## Running application

In development mode:

```
  ~ yarn dev

  ~ yarn queue:dev
```

In production mode:

```
  ~ yarn build
  ~ yarn start

  ~ yarn queue
```

# üìó Documentation

There is a file called `insomnia.json` in the root of application, that is the exported documentation of [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

Insomnia is a software similar to postman, you use that to test the requests to your application server side, seeing the response for each route with it params.
